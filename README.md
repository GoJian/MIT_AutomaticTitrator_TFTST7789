# MIT_AutomaticTitrator_TFTST7789
 Auto Titration Machine at MIT (Bosak Lab)

This program engages with multiple sensors for long-term data logging. It also actuates a stepper motor using a Trinamic driver board (TMC5160 SilentStepStick) when needed (for automatic acid/base titration, for example). It is designed to log data locally while also sends them over to an IoT server for real time storage and rapid analysis.

This project is under active development at the current time.
